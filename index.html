        <p>Welcome to my website! You'll find whatever you need to know about me, but as of now, you'll see that I can't reveal all of my information since I am testing my dedication to develop this website which is hard. The <i>about</i> and <i>diary</i> sections are pages where you can really find information about me and the <i>projects</i> section is where you'll find programs I made by myself. This website is made by and for myself and I intend to keep it that way, it's a way to express myself in the internet.</p>
        
        <p>In this page, you'll see the primary links available to the website, the sites where I frequent for learning purposes.</p>
